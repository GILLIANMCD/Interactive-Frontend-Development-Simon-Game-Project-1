# Interactive Front End Development Project - Simon Game

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. I set out to emulate the original game as much as possible, with features such as skill level and  strict mode. Using bootstrap grid to ensure mobile first responsive design this game can be played on any device. 

## UX
 
The website is for  players of all ages who want to challenge and improve their memory skills. 

## User Stories
- As a *player* I want *to be able to play my game on all of my devices* so that *I can play whenever I want*
- As a *player* I want *my memory to be challenged at different levels* so that *I can measure my progress*
- As a *player* I want *to see how many levels I have completed in the game.*
- As a *player* I want *to be notified if I have made a wrong move and restart the game.*
